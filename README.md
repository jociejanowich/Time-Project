This Java project implements a Time class to represent and manipulate time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It includes:
  -Constructors: Default is (00:00:00) and parameterized constructors
  -Getters & Setters: Access and update hours, minutes, and seconds with validation
  -Time Formatting: Display time in both military and standard formats
  -Time Operations: advances seconds, minutes, and hours, as well as compares time (lessThan, equals, greaterThan, etc.)
  -Copy Methods: Copy time from another instance or create a duplicate
  -Overrides: Custom toString method for easy printing
The main method deomonstrates its function. This project was useful for learning object-oriented programming, constructors, method overloads, and calculations.
